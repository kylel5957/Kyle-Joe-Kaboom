# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Joe Zheng and Kyle Lin**

## Context
We are students at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, we chose to study Kaboom in order to help us make an educational platformer game to help people academically while also engaging them in an effort to combat lower attention spans and doomscrolling.

To pair alongside JavaScript, we learned Kaboom as my third-party tool throughout the year to help us make the game.
