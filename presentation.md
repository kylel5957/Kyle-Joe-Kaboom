# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* 

## Product
* Provide URL to product and do a live demo
## Process
* Show MVP: Levels, sprites
* Demonstrate Beyond MVP: Checkpoint feature
* Snippets of different codes (both MVP and Beyond MVP)/game
* Blog entries -> show the process behind making the MVP and Beyond MVP (serve as context)

## Conclusion
* Takeaways:
    * "Taking time to understand documentations is key" - We had struggles on creating multiple levels, but we searched the p5js documentation and comprehended its instructions and visual examples, which led to our solutions.
    * "Problem decomposition" - We encountered many challenges while creating our Freedom Project such as making a checkpoint system. We took time to draw out the process of our code and then use logical reasoning to lead us to our desired outcome.
* End of with "Thank You!"

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
